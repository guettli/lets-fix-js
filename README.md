# Let's fix JS

JavaScript is everywhere. It got better during the last years, but some things are still  inconvenient.

## Long term goal: fix the flaws.

Before fixing the flaws consensus is needed.

## Current step: Write down the flaws

Before consensus can be reached, the flaws need to be written down.

## What is a flaw?

Everything which can be done simpler or more obivious is a flaw. 

If unsure, the [Zen of Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_of_Python) is a good general guideline.

Of course there is no single truth. Agreement need to be found by discussing and maybe voting.


## Feedback needed

Please tell me what you think:

- Which flaws does JS have?
- Why do you prefer a different language? What could be added to JS to make it more attractive?


Let's influence the future **together** :-)

## Flaws

### Equality
"Equality is one of the most initially confusing aspects of JavaScript."! http://adripofjavascript.com/blog/drips/object-equality-in-javascript.html

If it is confusing, then it is not obvious. This is a flaw.
