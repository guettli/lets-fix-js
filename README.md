# Let's fix JS

JavaScript is everywhere. It got better during the last years, but some things are still inconvient.

## Long term goal: fix the flaws.

Before fixing the flaws concensus is needed.

## Current step: Write down the flaws

Before concenus can be reached, the flaws need to be written down.

## Feedback needed

Please tell me what you think:

- Which flaws does JS have?
- Why do you prefer a different language? What could be added to JS to make it more attractive?


Let's influence the future **together** :-)
